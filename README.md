## DICE-ROLLER

DICE-ROLLER is a Flutter application that simulates rolling two dice using SVG images. The app uses animations to create the rolling effect when the user taps on the dice, and it displays the number that is facing up after the roll. Additionally, the app allows the user to keep track of their total earnings by saving the sum of the numbers on the dice to a wallet.
